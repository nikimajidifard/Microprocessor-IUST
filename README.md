# temperature-control-system
A system to control the motors and temperature. The implementation is for ATMega32 using c.
The schema is as follows:

Hence, the following steps have to be done:
* The ambient temperature is received by the sensor.(It is recommended to use the 35LM piece.)
* The ambient temperature is displayed on LCD.
* One motor is used for cooler and one for heater.
* Motors are turned on and off according to ambient temperature changes and considered temperature limits.

# calculator-ATMega32
A calculator that calculates the expressions due to the operation order.
A cicuit has been implemented in proteus software using ATMega32, LCD and a keypad which contains the mathematical operations.
By each click on the keypad the corresponding statement is going to be displayed on LCD and finally, by clicking on '=' the result will be displayed.
A sample is as follows:
